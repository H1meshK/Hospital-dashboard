# Smart Hospital Analytics Dashboard – Power BI Project

# Objective: Reduce patient wait times and optimize bed/ICU utilization in Indian hospitals through data-driven insights.

# Tools & Tech Used:
- Microsoft Excel – Dataset simulation & wrangling
- Power BI – Dashboard design, KPIs, DAX measures
- SQL – Operational queries

# Key Metrics Tracked:
- Average Wait Time
- Bed Occupancy Rate
- Readmission Rate
- Average Consultation Time
- Department-wise Patient Load

# Insights Discovered:
- **Emergency Department** has highest patient load and wait times
- **Cardiology** experiences the longest consultation durations
- **ICU beds are underutilized**; Cardiology & Neuro need reallocation
- **Peak admission time**: 10 AM – 1 PM, ideal for OPD load balancing

# Drill-Down & Filters:
- Department → Doctor → Treatment Type (Drill Mode)
- Heatmap of admissions by day & department
- Slicers for doctor, department, gender, admission date

# Recommendations:
1. Shift OPD load to non-peak hours to reduce wait time by ~28%
2. Hire 2 more staff in Emergency
3. Reallocate 4 ICU beds to Cardiology & Neuro

# Resume Line:
> “Developed a Power BI dashboard to analyze hospital operations across 1,000+ patients. Identified 28% reduction potential in wait times through department-level analytics and predictive bed allocation using Excel, DAX, and drilldowns.”
